# Design Document

## Overview

The A&S Design Studio website will be transformed from a single-page layout into a comprehensive multi-page static website while preserving the existing premium design aesthetic. The design maintains the current sophisticated color palette (Deep Forest Green, Warm Terracotta, Warm Stone) and typography system (Playfair Display + Inter) while expanding functionality and content organization.

The website will feature a modular architecture that allows for easy maintenance and content updates, with consistent design patterns across all pages. The design emphasizes visual storytelling through high-quality imagery, clean typography, and intuitive navigation.
